                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>AI systems are about to take decisions autonomously (e.g. intelligent agents). This requires them to estimate the state of the environment and itself. However, usually, the information and knowledge about the world is incomplete.</p>
                <p>Challenge: How should an AI system operate without complete knowledge in order achieve its final goal?</p>

                <h3> Uncertainty and AI </h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>What uncertainty is and where it comes from</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Uncertainty describes the fact that we cannot entirely trust, if a measured value or perceived state of a system, environment, or the world is the actual value or state. </p>
                <p class="note"> Uncertainty subsumes to information that is unknown, imprecise, or ambiguous.</p>
                <p class="note"> Reasons can be vagueness, conflict in information, missing specificity. </p>
            </section>
            <section data-background-color="aquamarine">
                <h3>Exercise</h3>
                <p> Look into the diamonds data set (EDA-exercise) and identify where uncertainties may be present and where they may come from.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Examples of uncertainty</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4> Measurement Uncertainty</h4>
                <p>Often measurements contain uncertainties regarding the expectable deviation of the measuring process.</p>
                <p class="example">A temperature sensor shows a deviation of &plusmn; 0.3 &deg;. (Uncertainty about the real value)</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4> Uncertainty of knowledge </h4>
                <p> The actual reason for the occurrence of a particular event is not really known or at best assumed.</p>
                <p class="example">The causes of getting a particular disease are unknown.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4> Uncertainty of occurrence </h4>
                <p> Im many cases, the time or location of occurrence of a particular event cannot be certainly predicted.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p> In bad weather situations, it is not possible to certainly predict if, when and where a lightning hits some considered infrastructure.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4> Uncertainty in actions </h4>
                <p> Taken actions are potentially uncertain to succeed, may have side effects or do not have the desired effect.</p>
                <div class="example">
                <p> Listening to an online lecture requires: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting up and prepared</li>
                    <li>Get a coffee</li>
                    <li>Go to the desk</li>
                    <li>Turn on the computer</li>
                    <li>Connect to the Internet</li>
                    <li>Connect head phones</li>
                    <li>Tech works at the lecturer side...</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4> Uncertainty in Perception </h4>
                <p>Sensors usually provide incomplete information about the world.</p>
                <p class=example>A GPS sensor gives the global position but says nothing about the local surrounding.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Summarized: main reasons for uncertainty</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment"><b>Laziness</b>: It is too much work to capture all possible influence factors for a situation.</li>
                    <li class="fragment"><b>Theoretical ignorance</b>: No complete knowledge about a domain.</li>
                    <li class="fragment"><b>Practical ignorance</b>: Not all necessary information can be gathered ("technically")</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Uncertainty vs. Errors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Similar: Difference between measured value and actual value</li>
                    <li>Errors: Often: Reason can be identified and potentially be fixed
                        <ul><li>by, e.g., improving sensor accuracy</li></ul>
                    <li>Uncertainty: it cannot be pointed out exactly where deviation comes from</li>
                        <ul><li>Uncertainty is tried to be described by a margin of accepted values</li></ul>

### Implicit methods
* Ignore uncertainty
* Build procedures that are robust to uncertainty
    * Monitoring and replanning 

---

### Explicit methods
* Build a <b>model</b> of the world that <b>describes the uncertainty</b> (system's state, dynamics, sensors, model)
    * Reason about the effect of actions given the model

### How to represent uncertainty

* What languages should we use? What are semantics of our representations?
* What queries can we answer with our representations? How do we answer them?
* How do we construct a representation? Do we need to ask an expert, or can we learn from data?

                <h3> Can we use (First-order) logic? </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Statements, predicates (FOL) evaluate to true or false, either.</li>
                    <li> Quantifiers (FOL) let us describe if something is valid for all, some, none.</li>
                    <li> However: Modelling with FOL requires "total knowledge".</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h3> What about Fuzzy-logic?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows modelling of partial membership to a statement.</li>
                    <li>But: Fuzzyfication makes a strict assignment based on deterministic rules.</li>
                    <li>$\implies$ Rules need to cover "total knowledge"</li>

                <h3>Belief</h3>
                <p>AI systems usually do not have total knowledge about a domain, its own state or the state of the environment. In best case AI systems have a <b>degree of belief</b> about relevant factors / statements describing the states.</p>
                <p>The main tool for dealing with <b>beliefs</b> is probability theory.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>What are probabilities?</h3>
                <p>Probabilistic statements are made about "possible worlds".</p>
                <p>A "world" describes one specific manifestation out of different possible.</p>
                <p class="Note">Similar to logical statements, however, these say <b>exactly</b> which worlds are ruled out (those, which are false).</p>

            <section>
                <h3> Introducing example: Tossing a dice </h3>
                <p class="example"> When rolling a dice once (<b>trial</b>) the probability for the <b>event</b> "roll a six" is $\frac{1}{6}$.</p>
                <p class="example"> Whereas the probability for the event "rolling an odd number" is $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Sample Space</h3>
                <p>Set of all possible worlds. All of them have a probability.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worlds are <b>mutually exclusive</b> and <b>exhaustive</b></li>
                </ul>
                <div class="example">
                <p> Tossing a dice 2 times the following worlds exist:<br>
                <p>$(1,1), \dots, (1, 6), (2,1), (2,2), \dots, (6,6)$</p>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Event</h3>
                <p>Usually, we are not interested in particular possible worlds but about sets of them. These sets are called <b>events</b></p>
                <p class="example">two dice add up to 11, doubles are rolled, etc.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3> Definition </h3>
                <p> $\Omega$ denotes the finite set of all possible events.</p>
                <p> $\omega \in \Omega$ denotes one possible event.</p>
                <p> If $\omega_{i} \in \Omega$ are mutual exclusive but comprehensive they are called elementary events.</p>
                <p class="example"> Elementary events of tossing a coin twice: ${HH}$,${HT}$,${TH}$,${TT}$ ($T$ = tails, $H$ = heads)
                </p>

                <h3>Probability Model</h3>
                <p>Assigns a numerical probability $P(\omega)$ with each event</p>
                <p>it holds:</p>
                <p>$0 \leq P(\omega) \leq 1$ for every $\omega$ and $\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} P(\omega) = 1$.</p>

            <section>
                <h3> Definition </h3>
                <p> If $A$ and $B$ represent certain events:</p>
                <p> $A \land B$ represent an event (intersection)</p>
                <p> $A \lor B$ represent an event (unification)</p>
                <p> $\neg A$  represent an event (negation)</p>
                <p> $A, B$ are also known as <b>random variables</b>
                <p> The set of all values a random variable can take is called <b>domain</b>.</p>

                <h3> Definition: Probabilities </h3>
                <p> The probability of a particular event $A$ is denoted by $P(A)$ </p>
                <p> If $A$ means "rolling a six", $P(A) = \frac{1}{6}$. </p>

                \begin{aligned}

                <p>also known as <b>prior</b> probability.</p>
                <p>Describes a probability value in absence of any other information.</p>

                    <li>Reveals already some information that might have an effect to the probability.</li>
                    <li>Probabilities taking evidence into account are called "conditional" or "posterior"</li>
                    <li>Conditional probability is written $P(A|B)$ means the probability of $A$ given $B$.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="example"> The probabliity that I take an umbrella with me ($U$), if it is cloudy ($C$) is $P(U|C)=\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

            <h3> Definition </h3>
            <p> For 2 events A, B, the probability P(A|B) for A under the condition of B is called <b>conditional probability</b> and defined by: </p>
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            P(A | B) = \frac{P(A&and;B)}{P(B)}

            <h3> Definition: Independence of events </h3>
            <p> Two events A, B are denoted as <b> independent </b> if it holds:</p>
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            P(A | B) = P(A)
            \end{aligned}
            \]
            <p> It follows: </p>
             \[
            \begin{aligned}
            P(A &and; B) = P(A) &middot; P(B)

            \[
            P(A|B) = \frac{P(A &and; B)}{P(B)}\,and\,P(B|A) = \frac{P(A&and;B)}{P(A)}

Convinced that a burglar has broken into his house (B), Holmes rushes to his car and heads for home. On his way, he listens to the radio, and in the news it is reported (N) that there has been a small earthquake (E) in the area. Knowing that earthquakes have a tendency to turn on burglar alarms, he returns to work.</p>
